class TravellingSales(mlrose.TravellingSales):
    """Fitness function for Travelling Salesman optimization problem.
    Evaluates the fitness of a tour of n nodes, represented by state vector
    :math:`x`, giving the order in which the nodes are visited, as the total
    distance travelled on the tour (including the distance travelled between
    the final node in the state vector and the first node in the state vector
    during the return leg of the tour). Each node must be visited exactly
    once for a tour to be considered valid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coords: list of pairs, default: None
        Ordered list of the (x, y) coordinates of all nodes (where element i
        gives the coordinates of node i). This assumes that travel between
        all pairs of nodes is possible. If this is not the case, then use
        :code:`distances` instead.

    distances: list of triples, default: None
        List giving the distances, d, between all pairs of nodes, u and v, for
        which travel is possible, with each list item in the form (u, v, d).
        Order of the nodes does not matter, so (u, v, d) and (v, u, d) are
        considered to be the same. If a pair is missing from the list, it is
        assumed that travel between the two nodes is not possible. This
        argument is ignored if coords is not :code:`None`.

    Examples
    --------
    .. highlight:: python
    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import mlrose
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> coords = [(0, 0), (3, 0), (3, 2), (2, 4), (1, 3)]
        >>> dists = [(0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 5), (0, 3, 1), (0, 4, 7), (1, 3, 6),
                     (4, 1, 9), (2, 3, 8), (2, 4, 2), (3, 2, 8), (3, 4, 4)]
        >>> fitness_coords = mlrose.TravellingSales(coords=coords)
        >>> state = np.array([0, 1, 4, 3, 2])
        >>> fitness_coords.evaluate(state)
        13.86138...
        >>> fitness_dists = mlrose.TravellingSales(distances=dists)
        >>> fitness_dists.evaluate(state)

    2. It is necessary to specify at least one of :code:`coords` and
